//        Which of the traversals are depth-first? Which are breadth-first?
//
//                The traversals that are depth first are Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals. Breadth first traversal starts with the root but checks it's neighbors in the next level before advancing into the next depth of the tree.
//
//        This differs from the depth first traversals because they concentrate on starting in depth of the whole tree first. For example, Inorder traversal starts at the farthest from room (in graphs the node on the bottom left) and it goes left-child, root, right-child. Then recursively replaces left child with the root and starts the cycle over again. Preorder traversal goes in logical order in searching for the nodes. Starting with; root, left-child, then right-child. Then replacing the root with left-child and recursively repeating the pattern. Postorder is opposite of inorder traversal. Postorder follows; left-child, right-child, root. Then recursively replaces left-child with root again, and follows the same pattern.
//
//        Choose one type of tree traversal and give an example of a situation, in which it would be useful.
//
//                For example, preorder traversal would be good if you need to analyze the root first before looking at the child elements. This will allow you to analyze the value at root first, which is useful for a binary tree sorting algorithm. In that case you are determing if the value is equal or greater than or less than the root. Then performing a action based on that.
